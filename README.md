# Neural networks
There are materials for «special math» classes.
Everything's done in jupyter notebook.
## Least squares
First task was to implement least squares algorithm.

Data generated as a function y = 2x+5+E.
     
    $ python3 least_squares.py
## Perceptron
At this moment only basic implementation without back propagation.
